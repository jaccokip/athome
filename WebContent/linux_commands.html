- direct copy of files to an output device. Allows creation of archive file spanning multiple diskettes. <br />
Allows one directory structure to be mirrored elsewhere on the partition or on another partition. <br />
In order to back up an entire directory structure on diskettes, cd to the directory and use the following command:<br />
cpio 

<ul class="command">    find . -depth -print | cpio -ov > /dev/fd0</ul> 

To restore from diskettes, use:

    <ul class="command">cpio -iv < /dev/fd0 </ul>

The cpio command will prompt the user to insert more diskettes as they are needed.<br /> 
The command for mirroring a directory structure is the following:<br />

    <ul class="command">find . -depth -print | cpio -pv /destinationdirectory</ul>

  - Gnu grand unified bootloader. Can be used instead of lilo to boot multiple operating systems. <br />
  I encountered a couple of snafus trying to install grub on my home machine after installing Mandrake 8.0 and choosing the lilo bootloader during the initial install.<br /> 
  The Mandrake installation program set up /boot/vmlinuz as a symlink to the actual kernel, vmlinuz-2.4.3-20mdk. <br />
  It took me a while to figure out that grub doesn't understand symbolic links. The documentation suggests installing grub on a diskette using the ``dd'' command.<br /> 
  This refused to work, but
<ul class="command"> grub </ul>

<ul class="command">    grub-install '(fd0)'</ul> 

did work. The single quotes are necessary. The files necessary to run grub are normally located in /boot/grub. <br />
Once the file menu.lst has been edited and appropriated entries added to boot the different operating systems on one's hard disk(s),<br /> 
the following sequence of commands can be used to install grub in the master boot record (MBR) sector of the hard disk:

<ul class="command">    root (hd0,x)</ul>
<ul class="command">    setup (hd0) </ul>

Here, the x should be replaced by the partition where the /boot/grub directory is located, which is probably the root partition of the Linux system. <br />
Note that grub has its own conventions for naming devices and numbering partitions, so that for example a partition which is called hda6 under Linux will be called (hd0,5) by grub.<br /><br />

<ul class="command">pwunconv </ul>
- interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
<ul class="command">python </ul>
- copy one or more files to or from remote computer. The syntax is poorly explained in the documentation that I have, including the man pages. Usage is:
<ul class="command">rcp </ul>

<ul class="command">    rcp filename username@remotehost:path</ul> 

The user's home directory on the remote system must contain the file .rhosts with a list of users (preceded by the full domain name or exact IP address of their machine) with access privileges.

<ul class="command">    localhostname username </ul>
- creates or changes the attributes of an RCS file. Stands for Revision Control System.
<ul class="command">rcs </ul>

<ul class="command">renice program_name</ul> 
- used to reset the screen characteristics. This is useful if the screen gets messed up from, for example, trying to display a binary file in an xterm.
<ul class="command">reset </ul>
- exits from a function. This is a shell builtin.
<ul class="command">return </ul>
- prints a summary of the history of an RCS file
<ul class="command">rlog </ul>
- log in to remote computer. The general syntax is as follows, using the UQAM Nobel machine as an example:
<ul class="command">rlogin </ul>

<ul class="command">    rlogin -l userid nobel.si.uqam.ca</ul> 

The remote computer must recognize the local user and the local machine. See the rcp command for how to set up the .rhosts file on the remote machine.
- remove files or directories. With the -r (recursive) option (very dangerous!), can be used to remove the contents of a specified directory including all subdirectories.
<ul class="command">rm </ul>

<ul class="command">rmail </ul>
- remove empty directories
<ul class="command">rmdir </ul>

<ul class="command">rmmod </ul>
- show routing table. The n option returns numerical addresses rather than names.
<ul class="command">route -n </ul>
- invokes the Red Hat package manager in command line mode.<br /> 
I often use this command in query mode to query packages about what files they contain and to find out which package owns a particular file. Examples are
<ul class="command">rpm </ul>

<ul class="command">    rpm -qil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package foo.</ul>
<ul class="command">    rpm -qfil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package that owns the file foo. Foo must be in the working directory, or the full path to foo must be specified.</ul> 

We need to find out about installing the rpm package on a Slackware box. It's probably better to use a package converter such as alien.
- an extremely useful utility on Slackware systems that converts rpm packages to tgz format. They can then be installed using the installpkg command (or pkgtool).
<ul class="command">rpm2tgz </ul>
- execute shell command on a remote computer. See rcp and rlogin.
<ul class="command">rsh </ul>
- summarize host's status: uptime, load averages, and current time
<ul class="command">rstat </ul>

<ul class="command">ruptime </ul>
- list who is logged on local machines
<ul class="command">rusers </ul>
- write to all users over a network
<ul class="command">rwall </ul>
- show who is logged in on a LAN. The rwho service must be enabled for this command to run.<br /> 
If it isn't, run ``setup'' as root. I don't understand this last remark, which comes from ``Linux Newbie Administrator Guide''.
<ul class="command">rwho </ul>
- a terminal program similar to xterm, but which has less features and uses less memory
<ul class="command">rxvt </ul>
- edits a file (not interactively). Also a tool for processing text files.
<ul class="command">sed </ul>

<ul class="command">setenv </ul>
- used by root to configure a serial port
<ul class="command">setserial </ul>
- set terminal attributes for a virtual console
<ul class="command">setterm </ul>
- set the id of a program when it is run. Used, for example, to give root privileges to a program run by an ordinary user.<br /> 
This is actually done by running the chmod program as root. See the chmod command for the syntax.
<ul class="command">setuid </ul>
- Slackware program to set up program sets and configure system. Setup devices and file systems, mount root file system
<ul class="command">setup </ul>

- split file into specified number of segments
<ul class="command">split </ul>
- secure shell. Apparently has many of the same functionalities as rlogin, telnet, ftp, rsh, etc., with better security and encryption features.<br /> 
We may want to learn how to set this up and use it.
<ul class="command">ssh </ul>
- front end to xinit in Linux. This is a script which starts up X clients and shuts down the X server on exit from the window manager.
<ul class="command">startx </ul>
- start the next X window session on the display 1 (the default is opened on display 0).<br />

- displays the last part of a file
<ul class="command">tail </ul>
- visual communication program that copies lines from one terminal to that of another user
<ul class="command">talk </ul>
- file compression and archiving utility. I find the syntax of this command to be frustratingly opaque. <br />
The following works for me. To use this command to unzip gzipped tarballs in verbose mode, use
<ul class="command">tar </ul>

<ul class="command">    tar -xvzf filename.tgz</ul> 

To create a tarball from files in a given directory and its subdirectories, use

<ul class="command">    tar -cvzf filename.tgz sourcename</ul> 

Sourcename can be the name of a single file, a wildcard such as *, or the name of a subdirectory. There seem to be two different conventions concerning gzipped tarballs. One often encounters .tar.gz. The other popular choice is .tgz. Slackware packages use the latter convention. The command can also be used to archive a file, a group of files, or a directory (with its subdirectories) on tape or onto floppies. If the material to be archived exceeds the capacity of the backup medium, the program will prompt the user to insert a new tape or diskette. Use the following command to back up to floppies:

<ul class="command">    tar -cvf /dev/fd0 filename(s) or directoryname(s)</ul> 

The backup can be restored with

<ul class="command">    tar -xvf /dev/fd0 </ul>

Tar can be used for other things. To mirror all the files and subdirectories in from-stuff to to-stuff, use the commands

<ul class="command">    cd from-stuff</ul>
<ul class="command">    tar cf - . | (cd ../to-stuff; tar xvf -)</ul> 

No tar file is ever written to disk. The data is sent by pipe from one tar process to another. This example is taken from Running Linux, p.177. To list the table of contents of a tar archive, use

<ul class="command">    tar tvf tarfile </ul>

To extract individual files from a tar archive, use

<ul class="command">    tar xvf tarfile files</ul> 

where files is the list of files to extract. When extracting files, tar creates missing subdirectories underneath the current directory in which the cammand is invoked.

in order to get a graphical login screen on the remote machine. See the discussion in connection with xdm below.
- display advanced power management BIOS information
<ul class="command">xadm </ul>
- converts standard output of one command into arguments for another. This is one of those powerful but obscure commands.<br /> 
Xargs reads arguments from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines,<br /> 
and executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any initial-arguments followed by arguments read from standard input. <br />
Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.
<ul class="command">xargs </ul>
- graphical mail delivery notification utility
<ul class="command">xbiff </ul>
- simple calculator program
<ul class="command">xcalc </ul>
- name says it all
<ul class="command">xclipboard </ul>
- Red Hat utility for configuring settings for X
<ul class="command">Xconfigurator </ul>
- used to start an X login session. This can be used to start a login session on a remote system. See the discussion on the following site:
<ul class="command">xdm </ul>

<ul class="command">    http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html</ul> 

See the man pages for X, xdm, and Xserver. As usual, the man pages are pretty obscure. The best single source seems to be the Xserver man pages. After X is configured, X needs to be started at bootup with the command (in /etc/rc.d/init.d/xterm):

<ul class="command">    X -quiet -query remotemachineaddress</ul> 

If the address of a nameserver is not configured, then the numeric address of the remote machine rather than its name should be entered. If the machines are connected through ethernet cards and the net, then obviously basic networking has to be set up. Gnome and KDE come with their own versions of X display/login managers, called respectively gdm and kdm.
- view a dvi file compiled under LATEX
<ul class="command">xdvi </ul>
- a simple text editor for X
<ul class="command">xedit </ul>
- graphical configuration tool for X
<ul class="command">xf86config </ul>
- graphical configuration tool for X

<ul class="command">xfd </ul>
- utility for interactive generation of figures
<ul class="command">xfig </ul>
- graphical file manager for X
<ul class="command">xfm </ul>
- tell X server that remote computer has access to your machine and that you will use the remote computer. This can be used to set up remote X sessions.<br /> 
To set up a remote X session on the UQAM Nobel machine, run the following command on the local machine (one doesn't have to be root to do this)
<ul class="command">xhost </ul>

<ul class="command">    xhost +nobel.si.uqam.ca </ul>

Then, log onto the remote machine using rlogin (see above) or telnet.<br /> 
Once logged in, use the following command to get the remote X server to open an X terminal on the local machine:

<ul class="command">    setenv DISPLAY localhostname:0 ; xterm &</ul> 

This is valid for csh, which is the default login shell on Nobel. For ksh, (and I think bash) replace with

    <ul class="command">DISPLAY=localhostname:0</ul>
    <ul class="command">export DISPLAY ; xterm </ul>

Other X-based programs such as Netscape or Gauss (graphical version) can also be run on a remote machine with display on the local machine with little trouble.<br /> 
The local X server is the program that has all of the information concerning the properties of the graphics card and terminal,<br /> 
so it must be necessary to have X running on the local machine. The following should also work.<br /> 
After using xhost to give permission to the remote machine to display on the local machine, use

    <ul class="command">netscape -display localhostname:0.0</ul> 

Question: can one start the X session on the local machine and then run a remote copy of a window manager?

If you already have whole bunch of iptables firewall rules, add these at the bottom, which will log all the dropped input packets (incoming) to the /var/log/messages
<ul class="command">iptables -N LOGGING
iptables -A INPUT -j LOGGING<br />
iptables -A LOGGING -m limit --limit 2/min -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTables-Dropped: " --log-level 4<br />
iptables -A LOGGING -j DROP</ul>
log dropped packets to syslog in ubuntu, this would be the quickest way:
<ul class="command">sudo iptables -I INPUT (5) -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: " --log-level 7</ul>
