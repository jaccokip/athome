A value of 1 is used for execute permission. See umask for default file permissions upon file creation. <br />
Chmod can also be used to change the suid bit on files. The syntax for the symbolic version is<br />
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">chmod </span></p>

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">chmod [options] who operation permission file-list</span></p> 

The syntax for the absolute version is

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">chmod [options] mode file-list</span></p> 

To set the uid to the owner's permissions, use

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">chmod u +s file-name</span></p> 

To set the uid to the group's permissions, use

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">chmod g +s file-name </span></p>

There are lots of security issues related to allowing a program to have root's permissions when run by an ordinary user. <br />
I don't pretend to understand all of these issues. <br />

- copies on or more files. Recursive copying is one simple way of archiving part of a directory structure. Use the command as follows:
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">cp </span></p>

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">cp -r /sourcedirectory /targetdirectory</span></p> 
- direct copy of files to an output device. Allows creation of archive file spanning multiple diskettes. <br />
Allows one directory structure to be mirrored elsewhere on the partition or on another partition. <br />
In order to back up an entire directory structure on diskettes, cd to the directory and use the following command:<br />
cpio 

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    find . -depth -print | cpio -ov > /dev/fd0</span></p> 

To restore from diskettes, use:

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">cpio -iv < /dev/fd0 </span></p>

The cpio command will prompt the user to insert more diskettes as they are needed.<br /> 
The command for mirroring a directory structure is the following:<br />

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">find . -depth -print | cpio -pv /destinationdirectory</span></p> 

 This copies the working directory and its contents, including subdirectories, into /destinationdirectory. <br />
 In order to copy an individual file which is larger than a floppy, use:

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">find . -name nameoffile -print | cpio -iv > /dev/fd0 </span></p>

- direct copy of file from one device to another. Can be used to make copies of boot or root diskettes for installing Linux. <br />
It can be used, for example, to make and exact copy of a floppy disk, as follows. First, place the diskette to be copied in the floppy drive. Then,
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">dd </span></p>

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 > floppy.copy</span></p>
    Replace the diskette with a fresh diskette.</span></p>
    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">dd if=floppy.copy bs=512 of=/dev/fd0</span></p> 

The ibs and bs options specify the block sizes for input and for both input and output. <br />
A boot disk image can be directly copied to a floppy using the second of the two dd commands above.<br />

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">dir </span></p>
- set colors for GNU ls command. In Slackware, this command is run by the /etc/profile script. <br />
Then, whenever xterm is run with the -ls (login shell) option, ls displays different colors for different types of files.<br /> 
Typical usage is eval `dircolors -b`. In Red Hat and Mandrake, I get color directories by aliasing the ls command (see below).
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">dircolors</span></p> 
- set display for output of programms under X Windows.<br /> 
Can be used to run a program on a remote machine while displaying the output on a local machine.<br />

Use -t landscape, which is one of the arguments to the paper type switch. If you have one page of a document that is a wide table, <br />
and you wish to print this in landscape mode, use
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">dvips </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    dvips filename -pp pagenumber -t landscape</span></p> 
- check an ext2 filesystem. The syntax is
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">e2fsck </span></p>

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">e2fsck /dev/devicename</span></p> 

where the filesystem is on /dev/devicename. The device should not be mounted, and this program must be run as root.
- write arguments to standard output. One use is to print out information about environment variables, as in

  - Gnu grand unified bootloader. Can be used instead of lilo to boot multiple operating systems. <br />
  I encountered a couple of snafus trying to install grub on my home machine after installing Mandrake 8.0 and choosing the lilo bootloader during the initial install.<br /> 
  The Mandrake installation program set up /boot/vmlinuz as a symlink to the actual kernel, vmlinuz-2.4.3-20mdk. <br />
  It took me a while to figure out that grub doesn't understand symbolic links. The documentation suggests installing grub on a diskette using the ``dd'' command.<br /> 
  This refused to work, but
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left"> grub </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    grub-install '(fd0)'</span></p> 

did work. The single quotes are necessary. The files necessary to run grub are normally located in /boot/grub. <br />
Once the file menu.lst has been edited and appropriated entries added to boot the different operating systems on one's hard disk(s),<br /> 
the following sequence of commands can be used to install grub in the master boot record (MBR) sector of the hard disk:

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    root (hd0,x)</span></p>
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    setup (hd0) </span></p>

Here, the x should be replaced by the partition where the /boot/grub directory is located, which is probably the root partition of the Linux system. <br />
Note that grub has its own conventions for naming devices and numbering partitions, so that for example a partition which is called hda6 under Linux will be called (hd0,5) by grub.<br /><br />

so I have to boot from a floppy. To create a boot diskette, I do the following (as root):
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">lilo </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    /sbin/fdformat /dev/fd0H1440</span></p>

To get this all the time, add

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    alias ls='ls -color=auto'</span></p> 

to .bashrc. The following command

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    alias ls='ls -Fskb -color=auto'</span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">rlogin </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    rlogin -l userid nobel.si.uqam.ca</span></p> 

The remote computer must recognize the local user and the local machine. See the rcp command for how to set up the .rhosts file on the remote machine.

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    rpm -qil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package foo.</span></p>
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    rpm -qfil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package that owns the file foo. Foo must be in the working directory, or the full path to foo must be specified.</span></p> 

We need to find out about installing the rpm package on a Slackware box. It's probably better to use a package converter such as alien.

- visual communication program that copies lines from one terminal to that of another user
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">talk </span></p>
- file compression and archiving utility. I find the syntax of this command to be frustratingly opaque. <br />
The following works for me. To use this command to unzip gzipped tarballs in verbose mode, use
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">tar </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar -xvzf filename.tgz</span></p> 

To create a tarball from files in a given directory and its subdirectories, use

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar -cvzf filename.tgz sourcename</span></p> 

Sourcename can be the name of a single file, a wildcard such as *, or the name of a subdirectory. There seem to be two different conventions concerning gzipped tarballs. One often encounters .tar.gz. The other popular choice is .tgz. Slackware packages use the latter convention. The command can also be used to archive a file, a group of files, or a directory (with its subdirectories) on tape or onto floppies. If the material to be archived exceeds the capacity of the backup medium, the program will prompt the user to insert a new tape or diskette. Use the following command to back up to floppies:

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar -cvf /dev/fd0 filename(s) or directoryname(s)</span></p> 

The backup can be restored with

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar -xvf /dev/fd0 </span></p>

Tar can be used for other things. To mirror all the files and subdirectories in from-stuff to to-stuff, use the commands

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    cd from-stuff</span></p>
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar cf - . | (cd ../to-stuff; tar xvf -)</span></p> 

No tar file is ever written to disk. The data is sent by pipe from one tar process to another. This example is taken from Running Linux, p.177. To list the table of contents of a tar archive, use

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar tvf tarfile </span></p>

To extract individual files from a tar archive, use

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    tar xvf tarfile files</span></p> 

where files is the list of files to extract. When extracting files, tar creates missing subdirectories underneath the current directory in which the cammand is invoked.

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xbiff </span></p>
- simple calculator program
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xcalc </span></p>
- name says it all
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xclipboard </span></p>
- Red Hat utility for configuring settings for X
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">Xconfigurator </span></p>
- used to start an X login session. This can be used to start a login session on a remote system. See the discussion on the following site:
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xdm </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html</span></p> 

See the man pages for X, xdm, and Xserver. As usual, the man pages are pretty obscure. The best single source seems to be the Xserver man pages. After X is configured, X needs to be started at bootup with the command (in /etc/rc.d/init.d/xterm):

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    X -quiet -query remotemachineaddress</span></p> 

If the address of a nameserver is not configured, then the numeric address of the remote machine rather than its name should be entered. If the machines are connected through ethernet cards and the net, then obviously basic networking has to be set up. Gnome and KDE come with their own versions of X display/login managers, called respectively gdm and kdm.
- view a dvi file compiled under LATEX
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xdvi </span></p>
- a simple text editor for X
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xedit </span></p>
- graphical configuration tool for X
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xf86config </span></p>
- graphical configuration tool for X
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">XF86Setup</span></p> 
- display an available font in X. Creates a grid in an x-term with one character per rectangle.
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xfd </span></p>
- utility for interactive generation of figures
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xfig </span></p>
- graphical file manager for X
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xfm </span></p>
- tell X server that remote computer has access to your machine and that you will use the remote computer. This can be used to set up remote X sessions.<br /> 
To set up a remote X session on the UQAM Nobel machine, run the following command on the local machine (one doesn't have to be root to do this)
<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">xhost </span></p>

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    xhost +nobel.si.uqam.ca </span></p>

Then, log onto the remote machine using rlogin (see above) or telnet.<br /> 
Once logged in, use the following command to get the remote X server to open an X terminal on the local machine:

<p><span id="command" class="pos_left">    setenv DISPLAY localhostname:0 ; xterm &</span></p> 

This is valid for csh, which is the default login shell on Nobel. For ksh, (and I think bash) replace with

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">DISPLAY=localhostname:0</span></p>
    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">export DISPLAY ; xterm </span></p>

Other X-based programs such as Netscape or Gauss (graphical version) can also be run on a remote machine with display on the local machine with little trouble.<br /> 
The local X server is the program that has all of the information concerning the properties of the graphics card and terminal,<br /> 
so it must be necessary to have X running on the local machine. The following should also work.<br /> 
After using xhost to give permission to the remote machine to display on the local machine, use

    <p><span id="command" class="pos_left">netscape -display localhostname:0.0</span></p> 

Question: can one start the X session on the local machine and then run a remote copy of a window manager?
